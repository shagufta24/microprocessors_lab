# Microprocessors and Interfacing (CS309)

## Lab Assignments (Assembly language programs)

### Lab 1

**problem1**: Print the internal representation (2’s complement form) of data stored in primary data types (int, float, and double).\
**problem2**: Perform addition and multiplication of two 32-bit numbers. The numbers can either be integers or real numbers. Integers are represented in 2’s complement form and Real numbers are represented using single-precision IEEE 754 standard.\
**problem3**: Convert a decimal number into an equivalent BCD number, and vice versa.

### Lab 2

**problem1**: Addition of 5 Integers\
**problem2**: Multiplication of 3 Integers\
**problem3** Evaluate 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ... + x^n (Assume that x and n are positive integers)

### Lab 3

**problem1**: To count the number of even numbers from a given series of 8-bit hexadecimal numbers.\
**problem2**: To count the number of values > 0, < 0, and = 0 in a series of 8-bit signed numbers.\
**problem3**: To find the parity of each number in a series of 8-bit hexadecimal numbers: odd parity should be represented using 01 and even parity using 00.

### Lab 4

**problem1**: Addition of two 3x3 matrices.\
**problem2**: Multiplication of two 3x3 matrices.

### Lab 5

**problem1**: To perform the addition of two n-byte numbers and store the result in third one.\
**problem2**: To sort n numbers using Selection sort.\
**problem3**: To find the factorial of n.

### Lab 6

**problem1**: To sort n numbers using Merge-Sort.\
**problem2**: To sort n numbers using Quick-Sort.

### Lab 7

**problem1**: To compare two strings. If str1 > str2 then display 1, else if str1 = str2 display 0, else display −1.\
**problem2**: To find if a string is a palindrome.
